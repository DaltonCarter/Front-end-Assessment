        <h3>Career Goals:</h3>
        <p>To tell you the truth, I'm not 100% sure what to put under this heading.
                Obviously I want the same things as everyone else; a livable wage or salary, to enjoy what I do so that when the going gets tough I can keep going.
            <br><br>
                You ask me where I see myself in 5 years and I'll tell you;
            Living in a place up in Washington state where most of my close support base is,
            In a respectable position with a company doing work that doesn't suck out my soul,
            In a place emotionally and mentally where I can let parts of my past rest,
            Have a book published or at least ready to publish...
            <br><br>
            This is a loaded topic as you can see, and thats just the cliff notes version. I could bore you to tears with the whole littany.
