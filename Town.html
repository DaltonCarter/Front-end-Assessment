    <h1 id="Town">RIMFOREST, CALIFORNIA</h1>

<h2>About the town and Picture:</h2>

<p>That picture is of Lake Arrowhead which is about 10 minutes away, there were no good pictures of the town itself. Rimforest is SMALL like modern village small. We have a gas station, 3 small restraunts, a lumberyard/hardwarestore, the electric company branch building, the gas company branch building, and equipment rental, a post office (because they don't deliver door to door here), and a small collection of houses that run the full spectrum from really nice and impressive, to hovels. It's both impressive and depressing for a town with less than 400 people living there.</p>

The tourist destination of choice is Lake Arrowhead itself, the entire town is essentially a resort centered around a mall. Click the link below for more info.

<br><br>
<p>You'll find a lot there...if you do visit up here for the love of all things sacred PLEASE mind you manners both on the road and in person.
    Too many people who don't live up here have either DIED or killed others or just plain caused injury from driving recklessly on the mountain roads in all weathers, or because they were stupid enough to PLAY IN THE ROAD, all of the roads up here are HIGHWAYS which means there is no right of way law for pedestrians, especially in the snow. Please, PLEASE take care and behave resposibly.
